OVERVIEW

"Extras" contains examples of (faster or especially elegant
or variant) renditions of textbook algorithms.  Typically what you
find herein are C sources, for which the Mathematica analogues
in the main PrimeKit directory were prototypical.

CONTENTS

4.1.6(theorem).konpom.nb : Special implementation by expert
     S. Wagon.

8.1.10.embedNoY.nb : Special direct-embedding, no-Y-coordinate
     implementation (not for commercial use; as there could be
     legal crypto issues; educational only). 

ellaffi.[ch] : Affine-coordinate elliptic algebra library.
ellmont.[ch] : Montgomerypparemeter elliptic algebra library.
ellproj.[ch] : Projective (IEEE) coordinate elliptic algebra library.
fmodule.[ch] : Factoring utilities, for moderate factors.
giants.[ch]  : General-purpose lartge-integer library.
tools.[ch]   : General number-theoretical tools library; it is
               this library that has some C manifestations
               of textbook algorithms.

factor.c     : General-purpose factoring program, uses "gears" of
               sieving, Pollard-rho, Pollard-(p-1), ECM.

schoof.[ch]  : Complete implementation of the Schoof point-counting
               algorithm for elliptic curves.  Handles curves over
               F_p, p an odd prime < 2^256.

tutorX.[ch] (various X)  : Tutoring programs, to show how one
               uses the various libraries.

AKS.c        : Implementation of the new AKS primality test.
